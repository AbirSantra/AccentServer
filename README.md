# Accent - A Platform for Artists and Photographers

⚠️⚠️ Please note that this project is still a work in progress. ⚠️⚠️

Accent is an online platform where creators like photographers and artists can showcase their work for the world to see, appreciate and buy.

## Features (Planned)

- Create Accents (posts)
- Users won't be able to right-click and save original artwork or photograph from the post.
- Posts will contain creator watermark to avoid plagiarism and content stealing.
- Search and add other creators as friends
- Like, comment and bookmark friends' posts
- Users can donate or send a tip for a post ($5 limit)
- Blog Section - for articles, tutorials, etc
- Marketplace for users to sell their work or buy others work (Ecommerce style now. NFT minting planned for the future)
